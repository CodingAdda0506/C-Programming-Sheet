# # Rectangle Area and Perimeter Calculation Algorithm

## Overview

This algorithm calculates and displays the area and perimeter of a rectangle given its length and width.

## Steps

1. **Start:**
   - Begin the algorithm.

2. **Input:**
   - Accept the length of the rectangle (let's call it `length`) from the user.
   - Accept the breadth of the rectangle (let's call it `breadth`) from the user.

3. **Calculation:**
   - Calculate the Area of rectangle (let's call it `area`) using the formula: `Area = length * breadth`.
   - Calculate the Perimeter of rectangle (let's call it `Perimeter`) using the formula: `Perimeter = 2 * (length + breadth)`.

4. **Output:**
   - Display the result by printing the Area and Perimeter to the console or output device as `Area:[Area]sq units` and `Perimeter:[Perimeter]sq units`.

5. **End:**
   - End the algorithm.
