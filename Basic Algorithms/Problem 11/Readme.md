# Prime Number Checker Algorithm

## Overview

This algorithm checks whether the given number is a prime number or not.

## Steps

1. **Start:**
   - Begin the algorithm.
  
2. **Input:**
    - Take the input of a positive integer (n) from the user.
  
3. **Process:**
    - Use a loop to check if num is divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of num.
   - If num is divisible by any number, it is not a prime number.

4. **Output:**
    - Display whether the entered number is prime or not.
      - Print "[num] is a prime number" or "[num] is not a prime number"
  
5. **End:**
   - End the algorithm.
