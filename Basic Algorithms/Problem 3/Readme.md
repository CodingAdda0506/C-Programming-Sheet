# Accept 2 Numbers and Display its Product Algorithm

## Overview

This algorithm describes the process of accepting two numbers from the user and displaying their product.

## Steps

1. **Start:**
   - Begin the algorithm.

2. **Input:**
   - Accept the first number (let's call it `num1`) from the user.
   - Accept the second number (let's call it `num2`) from the user.

3. **Calculation:**
   - Calculate the product of `num1` and `num2` (let's call it `product`) using the formula: `product = num1 * num2`.

4. **Output:**
   - Display the result by printing the product to the console or output device.

5. **End:**
   - End the algorithm.
