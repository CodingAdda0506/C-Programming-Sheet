# Leap Year Checker Algorithm

## Overview

This algorithm checks whether a given year is a leap year or not.

## Steps

1. **Start:**
   - Begin the algorithm.
  
2. **Input:**
    - Take the input of a year (year) from the user.
  
3. **Process:**
   - Check if the year is divisible by 4.
   - If divisible by 100, also check if it's divisible by 400.
   - If both conditions are met, it is a leap year.

4. **Output:**
    - Display whether the entered year is a leap year or not.
      - Print "[year] is a leap year" or "[year] is not a leap year"
  
5. **End:**
   - End the algorithm.
